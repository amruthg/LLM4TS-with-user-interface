# To install the dependencies, run the following command in your terminal:
# pip install -r requirements.txt

# How to run the model: 
# Ensure that 'app.py' is running locally and the localhost:5000 is open before starting the model.
# The files should be in the same directory format as provided.
# The coordinates shown in the website belong to Bangalore-rural. but different Latitude and Longitude details can be 
# given for different districts 

#The interface folder has to be opened in VSCODE and then the app.py has to run on the terminal and the localhost:5000 has to be opened in the web-browser.

#Since the model is using checkpoint from training on Bangalore rural data, it is useful for those coordinates.
#For other districts the app_with_self_training.py's code can be used but GPUs will be required as it is a very heavy process
